       "[Nice place Better than some reviews give it credit for.,\n",
       " Overall, the rooms were a bit small but nice.,\n",
       " Everything was clean, the view was wonderful and it is very well located (the Prudential Center makes shopping and eating easy and the T is nearby for jaunts out and about the city).,\n",
       " Overall, it was a good experience and the staff was quite friendly. ,\n",
       " what a surprise What a surprise the Sheraton was after reading some of the reviews.,\n",
       " it would appear there is a massive difference in the rooms, the South tower being the best.,\n",
       " Check in was very efficient and the room was lovely, very large with the most comfortable beds ever.,\n",
       " The hotel as stated is in a fantastic location and the Wrentham Village outlet is well worth a visit for bargain shopping ( the bus picks up outside).,\n",
       " The hotel bar is a little pricey ( not helped by the current dollar rate) but is a nice place to relax after a busy day shopping.,\n",
       " There is a number of restaurants close by.,\n",
       " A cab from the airport to the hotel can be cheaper than the shuttles depending what time of the day you go.,\n",
       " If it is not rush hour it is just under $30. ,\n",
       " Good location       Boston from 17th Floor of Sheraton Hotel \n",
       " Find an alternative to the Sheraton We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.,\n",
       " I felt like we were staying in a motel.,\n",
       " All toiletries apart from sampoo, conditioner and body lotion were not in the room.,\n",
       " Even the robe was not there.,\n",
       " For the price you pay, you do expect a little more.,\n",
       " Cleaning was done at eratic times of the day, ie 3.30pm!,\n",
       " The hotel is very busy with conferences and evening parties so there is alot of people around all the time.,\n",
       " The lobby is like a train station with the people coming through.,\n",
       " We felt that people staying at the Hilton accross the road, used the hotel as a short cut into the shops. ,\n",
       " Barely Tolerable,\n",
       " If it were possible to give one and a half stars, I'd rather give that-- the stay wasn't terrible,\n",
       " but it wasn't okay either.,\n",
       " It was tolerable, and that's about it.,\n",
       " I stayed at the Sheraton in Back Bay from November 21-25 for a business conference.,\n",
       " For a hotel whose primary purpose is to serve business travelers, I was horrified at the lack of complimentary services and the quality of those that that I was charged for.,\n",
       " Wired internet was $9.95 per night and very unreliable-- on the third night of my stay, the automatic prompt for daily payment wouldn't load.,\n",
       " After an hour with no luck, I called the front desk only to learn there is no helpdesk within the hotel and I was instead patched through to Sprint.,\n",
       " After over 30 minutes on the phone with a rep, I finally had the internet service reactivated, but for me having to go through this hassle was completely unacceptable while away on a business trip.,\n",
       " I had three small packages (8, 10, and 13 lbs) shipped to me at the hotel; on my bill at checkout, there was a business center charge for $53.,\n",
       " I was told by the front desk that there's work involved when guests receive packages and that the hotel charges a fee based on the weights of packages.,\n",
       " I always have packages shipped to me at hotel, and in my numerous, numerous stays at other hotels have NEVER been charged a fee to receive parcels.,\n",
       " Again, this is unacceptable for a hotel that claims it's for business travelers.,\n",
       " As for my room, I had a spectacular view from the 24th floor in the north tower, but that was really where the postives stopped.,\n",
       " My single room (queen bed) was incredibly small.,\n",
       " The desk was positioned at the foot of the bed and it was impossible to push the desk chair back all the way out from under the desk to get in and out because it hit the bed!,\n",
       " There was barely any clearance between the chair and bed even when the chair was pushed all the way under the desk.,\n",
       " The closet doors when opened blocked the bathroom door.,\n",
       " TV channels were limited and four out of five nights the satellite signal went out repeatedly while I was watching.,\n",
       " Valet parking is absurdly expensive at $41 per night.,\n",
       " Overall, the room was liveable but certainly no where near comfortable.,\n",
       " The location is great and can't be argued, but there are other hotels in the area (like the Hilton across the street) which may be better choices.,\n",
       " I would not stay here again. ,\n",
       " Great,\n",
       " Stay!       ,\n",
       " bath products ,\n",
       " One of the best! October 5 nights.,\n",
       " Got the Sheraton on Priceline and went with a certain amount of trepidation having seen the variety of reports.,\n",
       " What did we find?A wonderful hotel with wonderful staff, a wonderful breakfast, in a wonderful location.,\n",
       " We loved it!We were warmly greeted by Will on reception with the words I've got a nice suite for you on the 16th floor North Tower overlooking the Charles River.,\n",
       " Oh yes! - I'll believe it when I see it!.And see it we did, exactly as described.,\n",
       " I've lived in flats smaller than the room.,\n",
       " King size bed in alcove and large chest of drawers, desk and 3 piece suite with coffee table.,\n",
       " Two windows taking up virtually all the exterior wall with a view down to the river and to the Fenway on the left.,\n",
       " Nice size bathroom in good condition.,\n",
       " Even a small room off the main room with a work surface to house just an ice bucket and the coffee machine.,\n",
       " No safe but used the very effecient safety deposit box system in the lobby.,\n",
       " Hotel linked to the Prudential Centre so plenty of shops and eating places.,\n",
       " Also T stop without going outside.,\n",
       " We ate from the buffet breakfast each morning which filled us up until the evening.,\n",
       " Staff friendly and helpful especially Sophia.,\n",
       " We adopted her!Location is great with trolley tour stop right outside.,\n",
       " It could not have been better in anyway at all.,\n",
       " Would stay again at the drop of a hat. ,\n",
       " Too Small for,\n",
       " Too Much Money,\n",
       " The pros of this hotel: relatively convenient to Amtrak Train station; very convenient to the Hynes Convention center T, shopping, and eating; the staff was very friendly; free wi-fi and computers in lobby; Starbucks coffee in room and in lobby; pool and exercise room very nice (complete with sauna and locker rooms)Cons: the rooms are super tiny; our room backed up to an elevator, which was noisy all night, bathrooms are very small as well; our shower had cracked tiles and grout with mold/mildew in it; housekeeping came at random times during the day, so we never knew when they would show up; wired internet is $10/day; pool deck poorly designed and is VERY slippery bordering on a lawsuit waiting to happen.,\n",
       " If you're traveling alone and attending a function at the convention center, I would recommend this place.,\n",
       " But if you've got more than one person in your room, you should look elsewhere.,\n",
       " There were four of us in that tiny space, and it was hard on all of us.,\n",
       " We kept hearing the elevators all night. ,\n",
       " Nice lobby, but overall bad experience,\n",
       " So there are a mixed bag of reviews for this hotel, I'll add mine based on a stay in Oct 2008.,\n",
       " The hotel is connected to the Hynes Convention Center, you can't beat this for convenience.,\n",
       " That's the single upside of this property.,\n",
       " Now, for problems: old tube TV, turns out it didn't work at all.,\n",
       " Maid went to the bathroom in my room, left soiled T.P in the wastebasket.,\n",
       " Cost is quite high.,\n",
       " Valet parking $46/nite.,\n",
       " Wired internet in the rooms: $9.99, and it's slow.,\n",
       " Carpets throughout the room areas, both inside the room I stayed in, and generally outside in the hallways were in need of replacement or at least significant cleaning.,\n",
       " Room was dingy, old furniture, nicked and chipped up, Workspace for laptop work was stingy - no wrist supports, ethernet cable just barely stretched such that one can recline on the bed and compute.,\n",
       " Room was quite small - reservation said king, but when I arrived it was a queen bed jammed in this little room.,\n",
       " Bathroom reminded me of high school, same kind of industrial, bowl-less design.,\n",
       " Couple more pluses, actually: staff was pretty decent overall, and whoever does their elevator planning deserves an A+ - in spite of being quite busy, never had to wait for more than 10-15 seconds for an elevator at the lobby level.,\n",
       " Note I've been mostly staying in BB lately, so it had been a while since I've had to stay in a chain hotel.,\n",
       " Never again - no more chain hotels, certainly Sheraton is pushed waaay down on the list now, Motel 6 for them. ,\n",
       " Fantastic choice,\n",
       " This is great hotel for Boston visitors.,\n",
       " Rooms are clean and updated and the staff is very friendly.,\n",
       " The location is unbeatable.,\n",
       " It has a T stop attached to the Prudential Center where the hotel is, as well as two other T stops within a few blocks.,\n",
       " I would highly recommend the Sheraton in Back Bay \n",
       " Tiny tiny tiny6317453979 Booked it for $USD 415/night on the hotel website with an AAA discount.,\n",
       " 2 interior hallways down from the Hynes Convention Centre.,\n",
       " Free wifi on 1st and 2nd floors.,\n",
       " Free access to onsite huge gym with lots of weight machines and treadmills, and massive pool and cozy hot tub.,\n",
       " 7 minute run to Charles River.,\n",
       " Lots of eateries in adjacent area (Newbury Street, Prudential Mall, etc.).,\n",
       " Grocery store (Shaw's) directly across.,\n",
       " Closest T stop (Prudential, Green Line) is within connected mall.,\n",
       " Great view from 25th floor.,\n",
       " Old, dusty and a bit dingy in decor.,\n",

       " Ridiculously tiny bathrooms.,\n",
       " Quick elevators.,\n",
       " Uninterested frontdesk staff in response to complaints re: significant delay in arrival of requested crib to room. ,\n",
       " Great location, but inattentive to needs,\n",
       " I attended a conference at the Hynes Convention Ctr, and decided to stay at the Sheraton, which is actually connected to the convention center - just a short walk from the 2nd flr lobby.,\n",
       " Parking was expensive at $41./day, but the surrounding public lots were only a bit cheaper with no in/out priveleges and no valet service.,\n",
       " We had a 7 yr old and a 5 mo.,\n",
       " old baby, so we requested for an early check-in.,\n",
       " We were told at the desk that the room was not ready.,\n",
       " The front desk lady did not seem interested in helping, and we were told to just wait.,\n",
       " There were no changing tables in the lobby restrooms, so that was a challenge.,\n",
       " We were disappointed because she wasn't really helpful and didn't offer any consolation or extra concern because we had a little one.,\n",
       " I requested a room in the newly renovated wing, but was told there were none, bec.,\n",
       " the hotel was full.,\n",

       " I wasn't expecting the hotel to be that nice but we were very happy with the service and accomodations as well as the location.,\n",
       " We had a king suite on the 15th floor with a nice view of the city and St Charles River.,\n",
       " We could also see Fenway Park.,\n",
       " I would recommend that you request a room on the 15th floor or higher and facing the St Charles river.,\n",
       " The room was spacious.,\n",
       " The decor was just okay as was the bathroom.,\n",
       " Its probably time for an upgrade to the decor.,\n",
       " We enjoyed the pool, jacuzzi and sauna which weren't crowded at all.,\n",
       " We had breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant.,\n",
       " Both times we had the breakfast buffet, which is a little on the pricey side ($20) but a better deal than ordering a la carte.,\n",
       " Our waitress both times was Sophie who is the sweetest women who gave us bottled water for the road.,\n",
       " Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful.,\n",
       " The location, Copley Place/Back Bay is excellent.,\n",
       " There are many restaurants (recommend Sel De La Terre and Atlantic Fish Co), bars and historical sites in walking distance.,\n",
       " The trolley tour we took picked us up right outfront of the hotel.,\n",
       " Also, its right next to the Prudential Center and near Copley Place.,\n",
       " Really the location can't be beat!! ,\n",
       " Air con bke one night and took two hours to fix.,\n",
       " Got the night for free!       ,\n",
       " Pool \n",

       " Worst Hotel,\n",
       " Ever, Please don't stay here!,\n",
       " This Sheraton Hotel is the worst of all hotels I have ever been.,\n",
       " My husband and I ate breakfast at the buffet downstairs, and we paid the whole bill with a 20% tip.,\n",
       " The waiter came to collect the money, and before he even open it, he had the guts to ask us if we gave him any tips!,\n",
       " So, i have to say Sheraton is the worst of all hotels, and it is not a 4 star at all, with staff like this.,\n",
       " I thought 4 star hotel means they are personal and friendly, but this is exactly opposite to what my experience has been.,\n",
       " Please never ever pick this hotel.,\n",
       " The staffs in the rooms are unfriendly, and provide the worst service. ,\n",
       " not as bad as some reviews make it out to be stayed in the sheraton boston on vacation from the 16th sept to the 21st sept.hotel is nicely located for getting around the city with a t stop located at the prudential centre which is attached to the hotel.on arrival we were checked in quickly with no problems by very friendly staff,and given complimentary postcards which reception posted free of charge.,\n",
       " Room was on the 17th floor of the north tower.bathroom was spacious,room a fine size and,\n",
       " we had a great view of cambridge and the massachussetts turnpike and could just see fenway park.,\n",
       " Mostly had breakfast in the prudential centre but had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning.,\n",
       " Like all hotels it was dear enough but you could stock up as often as you wanted with the breakfast buffet for $20.Better options in the prudential centre or nearby try the pour house on newberry street.,\n",
       " The free internet access in the lobby was often unavailable with sometimes only 1 out of 6 computers working but that was only a small problem.,\n",
       " Staff were obliging and very helpful.,\n",
       " Overall,this was a much better hotel than we had been led to believe from previous reviews and we had little or no problems there. ,\n",
       " Hang on to your confirmation I wish I could give 4 stars for the hotel and 2 stars for check-in.,\n",
       " We stayed here for one night on 9/18.,\n",
       " We had RESERVED a Club Level room through Starwood points (this is a great deal, only 1,000 points more than a regular room).After a rocky dropping off of the car (there were no valets around, so we got the attention of the doorman, then had to deal with the irate suddenly appearing valets because we usurped their tip...,\n",
       " ah, it was not pleasant)...on to the inside...checking in and I knew in advance that the North Tower was the Club level, and where we were supposed to be, but the check in clerk assigns us a room in the South Tower...,\n",
       " hmmm...,\n",
       " I said what a pain, you mean we have to come down in the elevator to the lobby, cross over, then go up to the North Tower for the concierge lounge?,\n",
       " He says your room does not have access to the CL, but we can give you it for an extra fee...,\n",
       " I said I RESERVED the Club Level,\n",
       " , he asked to see my confirmation, I whipped it out...AND HE HAD TO GO IN THE BACK TO CHECK WITH HIS SUPERVISORI felt like I was buying a car!,\n",
       " well, Ma'am, I'll go ask my boss if we can swing this monthly payment...he comes back and tap tap tap on the computer and suddenly we were in a CL room that 10 minutes before had been not available.,\n",
       " Hors d'oeuvres were great, dessert was great, breakfast was fine (cold Continental)...well worth the 1,000 extra points.,\n",
       " I loved sitting there overlooking the Charles...,\n",
       " the room was nothing special - it DID have the Ralph Lauren decor as promised, but it's an old hotel built in the 70's or whenever so the rooms aren't HUGE, the bathrooms are SMALL, but the nicely renovated room and the club level were well worth it. ,\n",
       " A hotel designed by accountants,\n",
       " This is the second time this year I've stayed at a Sheraton, and the general experience is the same.,\n",
       " The hotel feels as though it was designed by accountants.,\n",
       " There is no attention to the comfort of those of us who stay here, rather the attention is on the photo-ops and the lobby.,\n",
       " Lobby was lovely.,\n",
       " Room was pretty bad.,\n",
       " Bed was large, but the bedding was uncomfortable and scratchy and the pillows, though plentiful, were hard-as-a-rock horrors.,\n",
       " The window didn't open though the view was ok.,\n",
       " Curtains didn't close all the way.,\n",
       " The bathroom was passable but no better than a cheap motel on the highway.,\n",
       " Online access cost $$ and was by 1 ethernet cable - not wireless - so only one of us could go online at a time.,\n",
       " Soda machines owned by Pepsi,\n",
       " so a pathetic few overpriced choices of overly large pepsi products in hideous plastic bottles, no cans, no other brands.,\n",
       " Complimentary USA Today which I really HATE. How about a Boston Globe, folks?,\n",
       " Oh, and the decor in the hallways was flat out hideous.,\n",
       " Hire a decorator with taste, Sheraton, how's that for a revolutionary idea?,\n",
       " The price for this mediocrity was outrageous.,\n",
       " Note to self: don't go to Sheratons, they rip you off. ,\n",
       " Room allocation is critical it would seem Stayed here 3 nights in mid September whilst at a conference in the adjoining Hynes Convention Center.,\n",
       " The hotel is convenient as it is part of the Prudential Center and thus its a very short inside walk to the convention center.,\n",
       " As a result of this (and because of reading some of the reviews here on Trip Advisor regrading the food) we didn't use any of the hotel facilities as the Prudential Center has everything one needs.,\n",
       " Room allocation appears to be key.,\n",
       " This is borne out reading other reviews.,\n",
       " My room was very small with an uncomfortably small bath room.,\n",
       " The room suffered from significant plumbing noises.,\n",
       " I couldn't decided whether this was something to do with the aircon or it was water rushing through pipes.,\n",
       " Whatever there was an obtrusive rushing sound and then a 'bang' when it cut off.,\n",
       " Given that the noise generally started about 4:00am ish and continued relentlessly throughout the remainder of the early morning I suspect it was the plumbing, or specifically, the flushing.,\n",
       " On the plus side thee bed was very comfortable and everything in the room worked.,\n",
       " The walls in this part of the hotel (North Tower - 20th floor) are thin and it was noisy.,\n",
       " For example could hear next door flicking the light switches.,\n",
       " Others have commented on this.,\n",
       " So, judging on my experience alone, I'd not be impressed.,\n",
       " However, my colleague down the hall had a much bigger room and none of the aforementioned issues!,\n",
       " As a SPG member with a few points to my name I would have expected a better room - a feeling confirmed when it transpired that my colleague and I had inadvertently swapped rooms and I should have been in the bigger one without the plumbing noises.,\n",
       " It does make me wonder however whether the 'noisy small' rooms are allocated to those paying the conference rate or whether it was just luck of the draw.,\n",
       " Internet was $9.95 + $.50 'telephone tax' for 24 hours and worked fine.,\n",
       " They also have free wifi in the lobby,\n",
       " so if you just want to check email in the morning/evening you don't have to pay at all.,\n",
       " For me the experience was adequate - my colleague would rate it higher.,\n",
       " If I had the choice between this hotel and one of equal standard at the same rate I'd try the other. ,\n",
       " Treat the desk clerks nicely I stayed at the sheraton boston for 3 nights at the beggining of the month.,\n",
       " I was checking in late, around 8pm and the guy in front of me was arguing with the front desk clerk over not having club access,\n",
       " , this is apparently the special top floor of the hotel with included breakfast and snacks as I was to find out later.,\n",
       " When I got to the desk I was expecting the worst but was greeted with a smile even after he was just chewed out.,\n",
       " The clerk made great small talk and after tipping him a 20 we were upgraded to a beautiful suite on the Club level which had a fantastic view and included access to a continental breakfast and some snacks at night.,\n",
       " Im from Las Vegas and I know how far tipping the front desk goes.,\n",
       " They have a beautiful swimming pool with a retractable roof and friendly cleaning staff.,\n",
       " Even the made who spoke very little english was genuinely friendly and was always smiling.,\n",
       " Theres a ton of great shopping within walking distance and great restaurants as well, try Haru for excellent sushi!,\n",
       " The concierge staff blew me away with their knowledge of the area and Jerry was more than kind enough to help with any reservations or suggestions.,\n",
       " Dont be afraid to walk this city if the weather is nice, you are walking distance from everything and we found ourselves walking from one place to another just exploring the sites until we found ourselves on the other side of town!,\n",
       " but if you end up too far away theres always the subway which goes right to the prudential center where the hotel is located.,\n",
       " all in all a wonderful stay. ,\n",
       " Love the Sheraton!!,\n",
       " But thin walls... I loved this hotel.,\n",
       " It was near enough perfect.,\n",
       " The staff were very very friendly and did not hesitate to help you with any queries that we had.,\n",
       " It was in a perfect location with a trolley stop right outside your front door.,\n",
       " The hotel was attached onto a shopping mall which was perfect for having breakfast in the morning.,\n",
       " We used to pop into 'Au bon pain' every morning.,\n",
       " It is also right next door to a cheesecake factory which is just a lush dining experience.,\n",
       " We stayed on the 25th floor and the views were spectacular.,\n",
       " The beds were also really comfortable.,\n",
       " There was only one slight problem.,\n",
       " The walls were very thin so you could hear everything that was going on in your neighbours room, even thier nocturnal activities if you understand what I mean... ,\n",
       " No character but overall worth the money Well positioned hotel (Prudential stop on the subway) - not a lot to recommend it from a character point of view but has excellent facilities - especially the beds that are enormous.,\n",
       " Good service and pool and gym area was a bonus.,\n",
       " Free internet access in the lobby and a starbucks made it the perfect base to explore Boston from for a few days. ,\n",
       " No compliants for the Sheraton Boston!,\n",
       " Great room with a great view!,\n",
       " Lovely to gaze out of the window when the city lights are on.,\n",
       " Room was cosy, quiet, and spacious.,\n",
       " The bed was dreamy indeed!,\n",
       " I could have stayed in it and not gone to any of the 3-day conference which I came for.,\n",
       " :-)Hotel is connected to Prudential Center, which offers lots of shopping (some not for cheap) and a food court.,\n",
       " Browsed around there on some breaks from the conference.,\n",
       " The Center has a beautiful courtyard you can go sit outside and read or eat.,\n",
       " The Sheraton is within walking distance of restaurants, grocery stores, the T line, and other hotels.,\n",
       " We took the T to all the touristy spots like Cheers and Havard.,\n",
       " It's also minutes from the Charles River...,\n",
       " so if you want to go for a walk on the paved paths, it's not far.,\n",
       " The only thing that I didn't get is why the hotel doesn't have more signs on it so you can see it when exiting the T station.,\n",
       " No shuttle services to the airport, either, which I also thought was strange. \n",
       " Loved it!!,\n",
       " Firstly a great hotel.,\n",
       " The sheraton was in a perfect location for us, pretty central and pretty close to the airport.,\n",
       " Upon arrival we were greated by an amazing lobby, with marble floors and great lighting.,\n",
       " The staff were fantastic, very helpful and the checkin was a breeze.,\n",
       " We stayed in a standard room, which was fantastic, the room had 2 double beds and was great.,\n",
       " I love the colour scheme of the room, and the beds were great!The bathrooms were a different story, there were very dated and were not great, but the room really did make up for the bathroom.,\n",
       " The sheets used by the shearton are top notch and soooo comfy.,\n",
       " Another handy feature used by this hotel is in room check out which was great. ,\n",
       " Very much,\n",
       " Satisfied I should start off by saying I booked this 2 night stay (9/6 to 9/8) through my sister who works for Starwood.,\n",
       " This might have had some impact on the room I was given  my experience.,\n",
       " Check in/out was quick even though we were early for check in by a few hours.,\n",
       " We were on the starwood preferred guests floor.,\n",
       " I don't know what that entails.,\n",
       " I was in room 2665 which had a king size bed, desk  chair, flat screen tv (32 inches I think), sofa chair w/ foot rest, small ottoman under a full length mirror, and a cushioned bench at the foot of the bed.,\n",
       " The mattress was VERY comfortable.,\n",
       " The room was clean.,\n",
       " It had 2 huge windows (corner room) which had fabulous views of boston.,\n",
       " The maid service was good.,\n",
       " Replaced all towels  toiletries  tidied up.,\n",
       " We used valet parking.,\n",
       " It was about $40 a day.,\n",
       " They ask that you give 30 minutes notice that you need your car but they will get it to you in about 10 minutes.,\n",
       " Internet is $4.50 for 1/2 hour or $9.00 for 24 hours.,\n",
       " Doesn't make much sense to me but we went with the 24 hrs.,\n",
       " We also had some phone charges when the only thing we called was within the hotel.,\n",
       " We probably should have questioned it.,\n",
       " It was a couple of bucks.,\n",
       " The bathroom was clean.,\n",
       " Not the newest but it was pretty nice  clean.,\n",
       " The toilet flushed SO loudly.,\n",
       " It was almost like an airplane.,\n",
       " It woke up my husband one night when I used it in the middle of the night.,\n",
       " We ordered room service breakfast one morning.,\n",
       " The lady who brought it was very nice  rolled it into the room  set everything up for us.,\n",
       " The food wasn't that great though.,\n",
       " I had a coupon for 50% off otherwise it would have been very expensive for mediocre food.,\n",
       " All in all, I liked the hotel  would stay here again.,\n",
       " The negatives I listed didn't affect our stay very much and as my husband says, I am extemely picky  notice everything. ,\n",
       " What a difference a room makes We got a special conference rate ($150) and were first given a disappointing room on the 9th floor in the north tower.,\n",
       " It was dark and shabby and smelled of old smoke.,\n",
       " It also had 2 double beds and we had booked a king.,\n",
       " After waiting on hold for 10 minutes with the front desk, we finally went back downstairs to complain.,\n",
       " Finally we were given a room on the top floor (29th) of the south tower.,\n",
       " It's a Starwood Preferred Guest floor.,\n",
       " Wow!,\n",
       " Very nice.,\n",
       " New and tasteful carpet and furnishings, and a fabulous view of the Christain Science Plaza fountain through a huge picture window.,\n",
       " What an improvement!,\n",
       " I'm so glad we didn't settle for the first room. ,\n",
       " Great location, great business hotel - Safe bet       ,\n",
       " Interior of Prudential Center \n",
       " Great room, nice staff, terrible food I stayed at the Boston Sheraton for 4 days while attending a conference on-site there.,\n",
       " My room was very clean, pretty, and comfortable.,\n",
       " I also found the staff to be very friendly, even confirming my late arrival with a personal email.,\n",
       " The hotel food, however, was terrible.,\n",
       " Not much better than TV dinners.,\n",
       " Also, they could do better to soundproof their rooms as you can hear everyone coming and going when they open and close their room door-- it is very loud.,\n",
       " A nice benefit of this hotel is that they have about 10 free computers for use in the lobby.,\n",
       " It is very convenient if you need to work or just check email.,\n",
       " Also, the setting is nice.,\n",
       " Would I stay here again?,\n",
       " I would probably stay across the street at the Marriott where I stayed a few months ago -- the rooms there are smaller but there is much better food and much better sound proofing.,\n",
       " (Both hotels are connected to the mall and conference centre via an enclosed skyway). ,\n",
       " Nice hotel I stayed at this hotel for a professional conference.,\n",
       " As far as conference hotels go, this was definitely one of the nicer places I've stayed in.,\n",
       " The staff were nice and courteous and the room was clean.,\n",
       " The other nice aspect of the hotel was it's direct connection to a large mall on the second floor.,\n",
       " In addition, you could not beat the location.,\n",
       " There were several malls and tons of shopping in the area.,\n",
       " We were also walking distance from trollies (i.e. subways) and historic tourist sites.,\n",
       " While not charming like boutique hotels, it was satisfactory for a large chain. ,\n",
       " Bed bug bites  I've been traveling for the last 8yrs for work and this was by far one of the worst experience.,\n",
       " I woke up in the middle of the nite with bug bites all over my body.,\n",
       " Not only I had to pack everything and move to a different room, I had to ask this rude staff over and over again for some itch ointment.,\n",
       " The staff is very unprofessional and they treat you like as if you're bothering them when you call.,\n",
       " I can't believe I'm paying all this money(although,\n",
       " my company is paying for it) for this kind of service.,\n",
       " I tried to walk over to Hilton, but it's sold out.,\n",
       " Also, ask for South tower, I think that's the newly renovated tower.,\n",
       " I'm still stuck in this old north tower with worn out carpet and furnitures, but I hope the new rooms are cleaner and don't have any bed bugs. ,\n",
       " Thin walls at the Sheraton We stayed at the Sheraton July 26-30 and for the most part had a good stay.,\n",
       " The elevators were super fast when we stayed there.,\n",
       " Great location within walking distance to Fenway,\n",
       " well really you can walk about anywhere from here and one of the trolley tours stops right across the street from the front of the hotel.,\n",
       " However every night we had noisy neighbors.,\n",
       " The first night the staff had to come get on to them for being loud partying.,\n",
       " The other two nights the couple were doing other things...,\n",
       " My husband had to beat on the wall at 4:30 in the morning to get them to be quiet.,\n",
       " When I told staff about it the next day they did give me all of my room charges basically free.,\n",
       " Still doesn't make up for lost sleep though.,\n",
       " So beware of very thin walls here.,\n",
       " Otherwise a great trip and can't wait to come back. ,\n",
       " Much Better than expected Given the mixed reviews we were not sure what to expect.,\n",
       " I have to say that we had a great time.,\n",
       " The hotel is a typically anonymous conference style hotel with a dark and somewhat depressing reception and slow front desk service.,\n",
       " Our 2 adjoining rooms on the 19th floor were really good.,\n",
       " The beds were comfortable, the views excellent and with all the facilities you would expect.,\n",
       " The gym is big and the pool, whilst not so big ,was enough to keep the kids happy.,\n",
       " We used the sun terrace and the jacuzzi.,\n",
       " And the location is great.,\n",
       " So not the place to go if you are looking for character or special hotel experience, but it really did the job for us. ,\n",
       " DIRTY Room / RUDE Staff,\n",
       " My husband and I and three children were disappointed with our stay at the Sheraton Boston last weekend (July 26th - 27th).For starters, before arriving we called the hotel to request two beds and a rollaway cot in the room.,\n",
       " The person with whom we spoke was quite rude and stated that since we booked through Priceline, she could not accomodate any of our requests, that we were wasting our time speaking with her and we would have to see what was available when we arrived.,\n",
       " Be forewarned, as mentioned in other revieiws, when we arrived, we were informed that the only option for parking our car was through the hotel's valet for a cost of $41 per night.,\n",
       " At check-in we requested a renovated room, but we were given a room on the 25th floor of the non-renovated tower.,\n",
       " At that time we requested a rollaway bed/cot.,\n",
       " The 25th floor looks worn (scratched doors, frayed carpet) and our room was horrible (looked like it was decorated in the '80s) - smelly with a huge stain in the middle of the carpet, stains on the dark blue duvet/comforters, rip in the blue velvet curtains, hairs and mold in the bathroom, dirt inside the drawers and a huge TV that looked about 10 years old which didn't get reception on several channels.,\n",
       " We complained, but were told that since we booked through Priceline, our room could not be changed.,\n",
       " (Regardless of how one books their room, it seems to us that guests should be enititled to clean, pleasant rooms...,\n",
       " )Three hours after we had checked in, we still had not received the rollaway bed.,\n",
       " We called the front desk to follow up, and after another two hours (long after we had hoped to put our youngest child to bed), the bed was delivered without any extra pillows or blankets.,\n",
       " When we requested these items from the guy who delivered them, he told us that these items were not available because they were all really dirty.,\n",
       " Our kids swam in the pool, but the hotel does not employ any lifeguards, so parents have to keep a close eye on their kids.,\n",
       " Due, in part, to the retractable roof, after sundown the pool area is poorly lit, and it's a bit tough to keep track of three kids in the pool without adequate lighting.,\n",
       " To get to the bathroom/locker room from the pool, you have to go through a freezing cold area where the treadmills are located.,\n",
       " The locker room is gross - uncleaned toilet, filthy showers, hair dryers sitting in puddles of water (not very safe).,\n",
       " All of that being said, the location of the hotel is fabulous - in the heart of Boston and attached to the Prudential Center which is an upscale mall with several restaurants and a great food court (which is convenient when you have kids to feed).,\n",
       " There are several other hotels in this area, and we suggest that if this location appeals to you, that you stay in a different hotel. ,\n",
       " Slow Elevators, good location,\n",
       " This hotel is well located in the back bay and is connected to the Prudential Center.,\n",
       " Our room was spacious, although the bathroom was small.,\n",
       " We enjoyed the flat screen TV.,\n",
       " The beds were great with nice linens.,\n",
       " The pool was nice with a lap lane and an adjacent hot tub.,\n",
       " My main complaint was the elevators...,\n",
       " they were VERY slow.,\n",
       " It took far too long for the elevators to come.,\n",
       " They should really think about updating them. ,\n",
       " Really slipped but great location and competitive pricing,\n",
       " This used to be one of my favorite hotels and even vactioned here back in the 90's.,\n",
       " Sad to see where it's goneThe service is still courteous with a smile, and you can't beat the location, there is a T stop in the prudential center doesn't get much better for getting around.,\n",
       " Reading some of the other reviews I found myself agreeing more than not.,\n",
       " I've been here in Boston for the last 5 weeks.,\n",
       " I hav stayed at the Marriott and the Hilton all with in a stone throw of the Shraton.,\n",
       " Sadly I rank this one third.,\n",
       " Whats Good.,\n",
       " Decent sized rooms, and hands down the MOST comfortable beds of all the chains in the area.,\n",
       " That's important to any business traveller.,\n",
       " Quality towels and Bath products.,\n",
       " Sheraton doesn't allow those old frayed towels.,\n",
       " The Pool, Gym and lobby are great as well.,\n",
       " Also again the Service is good, everyone projects helpfulness and I believe they are sincere.,\n",
       " What needs improvement.,\n",
       " Well for the bucks it's competitive, but frankly this hotel is in need of some major renovation if it wants to compete with the in room amenities of some of the other hotels.,\n",
       " The TV's and remotes.. well leave much to be desired.,\n",
       " Small Desks- Mine looks like a chouch end table.,\n",
       " Not muchto spreadout on, and,\n",
       " If I ordered room service I'd have to move my laptop to the bed.,\n",
       " The toilets look they are right out your high school gym.,\n",
       " Clean,\n",
       " yes, but old cracked tiles with stained grout stands out.,\n",
       " The Lamps are flecked with chipped paint from years of use.,\n",
       " And I am wondering the last time my phone was cleaned, as there is an interesting film around the ear hole.,\n",
       " Also No in room safes.,\n",
       " For a business traveller, well frankly it leaves you wanting more.,\n",
       " It reminds me of the old Hamton inn's before the national makeover.,\n",
       " But again The bed almost guarantees you'll sleep well.,\n",
       " Personally I prefer the LAN connections to wi fi.,\n",
       " So for m that's a plus over the Hilton across the street.,\n",
       " (All Wi Fi)Personally I haven't tried the food, becuase there are MANY great eating places all within walking distance.,\n",
       " The menu looks typical.,\n",
       " There's a burger, Pizza, a few salads etc.,\n",
       " Again I recomend eating out just for the variety.,\n",
       " Overall nothing special, it's a hotel, that's seen better days, but hey if you in Boston and just hanging out in your hotel room...,\n",
       " well you have much bigger issues than a hotel needing some TLC. ,\n",
       " So So The Good - Good location, friendly staff on check in, and many of the amenities that a business traveller might need.,\n",
       " The valet and bellman in the lobby were all very helpful and courteous.,\n",
       " There is also a full service Starbucks (not just a cart) on site in the lobby.,\n",
       " The Bad-Sheraton really needs to work on giving the rooms a good scrubbing.,\n",
       " There were stains on the carbet near the bed which did not help their cause.,\n",
       " Also, the floor right along the floor boards needs a good vaccuming with the crevice tool.,\n",
       " I also had a plate in my room which I brought up on Day 1...,\n",
       " .it stayed with me until Day 5.The Ugly-,\n",
       " The room was terribly small and a little tired.,\n",
       " The doors were so narrow that they remind me of those on a cruise ship where space is really limited.,\n",
       " Also, the bathroom was uncomfortably small, especially when staying sharing the room with the Mrs.,\n",
       " Conclusion-,\n",
       " This is definitely the spot if you're looking for a good priced, centrally located hotel with a reputable brand and don't plan on spending lots of time actually in your room (i.e., you just go there to sleep and shower).Otherwise, if you are the type of traveler that also values your aesthetics of your room, then you might want to consider other options. ,\n",

       " After arriving several hours late due to storms in the Boston area, we were told there was only one room left with a king-size bed (hard to believe, given the size of the hotel) whick we took.,\n",
       " After seeing the nice lobby, the large stain (close to two feet across) which greeted us on the hallway floor near our room did not leave a good impression.,\n",
       " The room turned out to be a handicapped-accessible one; on the plus side, the bathroom was large, on the minus side, the overall dimensions of the room were lacking.,\n",
       " There was only one washcloth in the room - we called the front desk, and several more were quickly brought up.,\n",
       " While unpacking, we noticed that the bottom of one of the drawers was coming apart, and, behind one of the nightstands, was trash that had been left by previous guests.,\n",
       " The next morning, we noticed that the showerhead would not stay in position.,\n",
       " We reported these three problems to the front desk the next morning.,\n",
       " The trash was removed and the room cleaned, but nothing was ever done about the showerhead, the broken drawer, or, later, the toilet that flushed like a min-geyser.,\n",
       " The bed was very comfortable, but the tv was old (no flat screen) and internet was not wireless.,\n",
       " The closet was very poorly laid out, since it had been adapted to be accessible nothing longer than three feet could be hung in it without being folded over.,\n",
       " The location of the hotel is excellent, as it is attached to a mall, and across the street from a subway stop, as well as being in walking distance to many shops and restaurants.,\n",
       " The pool was nice as well, and business services were fine.,\n",
       " Would I stay here again?,\n",
       " Definitely not if I were paying rack rate.,\n",
       " This hotel needs to improve its housekeeping, which tends to be inconsistent, as well as its maintenance.,\n",
       " It is very convenient if you are attending an event located in the attached convention center though. ,\n",
       " Needs improvement We stayed at this hotel for one night on points.,\n",
       " We had just come from the Hilton across the street and were so disappointed when we checked into the Sheraton.,\n",

       " There wasnéˆ¥æª› a mini-bar or a safe in the room, but there was a coffee maker and iron.,\n",
       " The bed was not comfortable; the bathroom was small with scratchy towels and there was no make up mirror.,\n",
       " We did have a nice view but the windows were dirty, so we couldnéˆ¥æª› even take pictures.,\n",
       " I would stay here again on points, but thatéˆ¥æªš the only way.,\n",
       " It just didnéˆ¥æª› have a good feel to it.,\n",

       " One year later, it still gets that same title.,\n",
       " Valet parking is a very high $41 which is the only negative comment about the hotel.,\n",

       " I've spent some downtime in the lobby previously and was impressed with the decor, business amenities and the big starbucks.,\n",
       " This time tho i stayed as a paying guest of the hotel - and tho the lobby is still a beauty - this hotel definitely has problems.,\n",
       " To begin with - $41 per nite come and go as you please valet parking.,\n",
       " That my friends is a shakedown.,\n",
       " Next - once you ride the elevator up from that beautiful lobby - the hotel proper is less than appealing.,\n",
       " My room was on the 24th floor and the carpet in the hallway was outdated and dirty looking.,\n",
       " The doors to the rooms were scratched up and in poor condition.,\n",
       " The room itself was of decent size with perhaps the best view i've had at a city hotel in years - looked out over the river and to my left i could see the dreaded Fenway - just an amazing view.,\n",

       " The carpet was old and like in the hallway - didn't seem clean.,\n",
       " As i walked barefoot in the room, i was a bit turned off to the feel.,\n",

       " Where is the FLAT PANEL.,\n",
       " Even worse, the in-room internet was wired - NOT WIFI.,\n",
       " Did i take a trip back to the 90's?,\n",

       " The beds are wonderful.,\n",
       " Got a last minute wonderful rate with breakfast included.,\n",
       " The manager told us they have renovated a few rooms as samples and told us the new rooms would be available next year.,\n",

       " Good value with starpoints, convenient location, recommended       View from room - Charles river, Back Bay, MIT dome \n",
       " Good location and well-managed I stayed for five nights as part of an Art Excursions Program.,\n",
       " The group was scheduled for the Club Floor (arranged by the program).,\n",
       " Reading some of the reviews frightened me, so I was not expecting very much in the way of services.,\n",
       " At check in, I requested a view of the river as well as a room on the same floor as the club lounge and received it.,\n",
       " Room 2916 was excellent, good size, with a sitting area and two large windows.,\n",
       " This might have formerly been two smaller rooms.,\n",
       " Occasionally there was noise from the nearby service elevator but it was not bothersome.,\n",
       " I found the reception staff extremely accommodating to my questions and requests, the club room staff very helpful and accommodating and the chambermaids very efficient.,\n",
       " One minor negative would be the condition of the sheets, they could stand to be updated.,\n",
       " Both changes had small holes and did not seem finished or ironed.,\n",

       " center, as well as, the attached mall.,\n",
       " Located really in the heart of the city so, easy to get anywhere.,\n",
       " I thought that the public space was very nice and I used the free internet in the lobby (like a laptop lane).,\n",
       " I thought the rooms looked a little dated. ,\n",
       " Great location; Needs some updating The Sheraton Boston is in a great location, attached to the Prudential Center and within walking distance of everything I needed.,\n",
       " As a Starwood member, I was upgraded to a room on one of the top floors with a fantastic view of the Charles River.,\n",
       " The woman at reception was very nice and even though I was early, they had my room ready for me.,\n",
       " The room was average (aside from the great view) both in size and decor, although it did have that fabulous bed.,\n",
       " The entire hotel felt dated with limited decor or ambience.,\n",
       " I'm sure they cater to conventioneers, but I like a little more character to my hotel.,\n",
       " The bathroom was very small and since there was no fan, the door needed to stay open when showering.,\n",
       " Great Bliss products, however and better towels then many hotels.,\n",
       " The only true negative was at the bellman's desk.,\n",
       " As I and several other guests approached to check bags for a couple of hours, the bellman at the desk hung up the phone and walked away w/o acknowledging us.,\n",
       " We all then waited about 5 minutes before another bellmen came from outside and very brusquely checked luggage with no eye contact or ounce of friendliness.,\n",
       " When I came to retrieve my luggage, the different men at the desk were very pleasant, as was the doorman that hailed me a cab.,\n",
       " All in all, if the price was right, I would most likely stay here again because of the location, but I would probably shop around for a hotel with a little more charm first. ,\n",
       " Dreary Hotel,\n",
       " I moved to the Sheraton after a few nights in the Westin.,\n",
       " No comparison- the Westin was MUCH better.,\n",
       " I stayed in the north tower.,\n",
       " The room was drab, the view was awful- pipes and ugly buildings.,\n",

       " (He wanted him to help someone else.)There was free internet in the lobby.,\n",
       " There were also apples at the front desk- a nice touch, and tasty, too.,\n",
       " The hotel was very conveniently located in the mall/convention center complex.,\n",
       " It was not as convenient as the Westin, though, being farther from the T and Newbury St. All in all, I thought this was a pretty mediocre hotel.,\n",
       " I would have been upset if I had had to spend more than one night here. ,\n",
       " $350 a night?,\n",
       " Ha!,\n",
       " Ok, so I stayed here last week for the NBA Finals and it has good things and bad things.,\n",
       " I'll start with the good things.,\n",
       " It's connected to the mall, free wifi and Kiosk computers down stairs, complete with Starbucks.,\n",
       " It also has two separate wings.,\n",
       " Make sure you go for the North Wing (to the right when you get in) as it's a world of difference.,\n",
       " The South Wing looks worse than a Holiday Inn and should not be more than $80 bucks a night.,\n",
       " The gentleman at CheckIn was kind enough to inform me that I would rather stay in the North Wing.,\n",
       " My friend did not get the same courtesy and after checking out his room, we had him switch immediately.,\n",
       " The staff are great as well.,\n",
       " Very friendly.,\n",
       " The bad things:,\n",

       " RATS in the hallways.,\n",
       " No kidding around.,\n",
       " We had booked the business rooms in the South Wing for our staff and sure enough, we see a small creature on it's way to work.  ,\n",
       " I'll be fair with my overall experience.,\n",
       " You should get what you pay for.,\n",
       " The North Wing should be $180 a night and the South Wing should be $80.,\n",
       " You want a great hotel, stay at the Intercontinental.,\n",
       " We stayed there for NBA Finals - Games 1  2 and it was by far the best hotel.,\n",
       " It was about $300 a night as well. ,\n",
       " Large Noisy Convention Hotel,\n",
       " This hotel was way too big for my liking and the room was very noisy.,\n",
       " Lots of traffic in the lobby and the hall.,\n",
       " It's connected to the mall so that's a good thing but overall, I won't stay there again. ,\n",
       " Roach Alert!!,\n",
       " Roach alert!,\n",
       " I booked this hotel for a long stay during the NBA Finals but ended up checking out the morning after my one and only night.,\n",
       " I arrived late, around midnight, after a long flght from L.A.,\n",
       " The hallway looked suspicious, doors scartched, carpet not too clean, but I made nothing of it as it was late and I was tired.,\n",
       " Then I got into my room (639).,\n",
       " The carpet was DEFINITELY dirty, with a lot of dark spots.,\n",
       " The only AC outlet was behind the tv and I had to move the desk, going down on four legs to reach it.,\n",
       " The work desk itself was so small you could hardly put down your laptop.,\n",
       " As I unpacked, I noticed hairs on the pillows and started getting the uncomfortable feeling that the hotel was not that clean.,\n",
       " Little did I know that as soon as I opened the bathroom door, a HUGE ROACH was waiting inside to welcome me.,\n",
       " I called management, they said they were sorry and send somebody to clean up, He got there 45' later.,\n",
       " But, of course, I checked out the next morning.,\n",

       " Good service, but old, small and shabby rooms We stayed here because of a conference at this property and,\n",
       " surprisingly, we were rather disappointed.,\n",
       " The staff were friendly however the North Tower rooms leave much to be desired.,\n",
       " Upon our arrival we were placed in a room that was in serious disrepair and very small: the comforters were lumpy, stained carpets and the bathroom was very tiny, dingy and had stained tiles.,\n",
       " We asked for a bigger, more updated room and were promised a recently renovated unit.,\n",
       " To our surprise the room looked as exactly as the other -with one change, the bathroom vanity had been replaced with a granite and wood unit.,\n",
       " The room was still very small, only one lamp worked as the rest of the lamps didn't have any lightbulbs, plus the TV remote didn't work.,\n",
       " Given all the choices in Boston, we would not stay here again.,\n",
       " p.s.,\n",
       " a friend stayed in the South Tower and LOVED his room - big room, bed and bathroom and flat panel TV - if you stay here request a new room in the SouthTower :) ,\n",
       " One Night Only, but Pleasant Experience We only stayed at this hotel one night because our other hotel had no vacancies for our last night.,\n",
       " We decided to choose a place in Back Bay, since we hadn't spent much time in this area.,\n",
       " The hotel ended up being pretty close to a lot of funky shopping and some pretty nice restaurants.,\n",
       " The hotel staff were friendly and the room was spacious and clean.,\n",
       " The price was a little steep for me, but if I could afford it, I'd love to stay here again for a longer time!! ,\n",
       " Nice beds...but not much else.,\n",
       " My husband and I generally stay away from chain hotels, and now I remember why.,\n",
       " The Sheraton Boston is, in general, a nice hotel but didn't offer much in the way of making their guests feel like home (like many small hotels do).,\n",
       " Upon arrival we were greeted by the nice bellmen and they explained that it would cost $42/night to park our car!,\n",
       " I was flabbergasted!!,\n",
       " I figured it would cost something to park, but not that much!!,\n",
       " We had no choice but to eat the cost.,\n",
       " Because of it, we never got to do a few things we had planned for the week (as we were on our honeymoon and short on extra funds - after paying for the wedding itself).When checking in, the woman at the desk overheard us talking about it being our honeymoon and upgraded us to a suite, which was quite nice.,\n",
       " The beds are comfy, but the room was lacking.,\n",
       " No fridge, no safe, $5 for 30 minutes of internet use and the bathroom was pretty awful.,\n",
       " Our apartment bathroom at home is nicer than this one...and that is saying a lot.,\n",
       " The tub was plain, showerhead was awful and the lighting was terrible.,\n",
       " I really expected more from a suite bathroom.,\n",
       " The Sheraton was a good place to lay our heads in between Sox games and touring the city, but we will not return. ,\n",
       " Wonderful Stay at the Sheraton!,\n",
       " We absolutely loved our stay in Boston at the Sheraton!,\n",
       " We received an amazing deal on Travelocity and even though I was a little leery about the large size of the hotel (I feared it would be impersonal or cold), we received very personal service and prompt attention at the front desk.,\n",
       " The bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel was quiet.,\n",
       " The Sheraton has a great location close to Newbury Street and conveniently attached to the Prudential Center where you can find anything you need!!!,\n",
       " I highly recommend the Duck Tour - it was a wonderful time - and you can purchase the tickets right in the Prudential Center - just be sure to line up early (outside the Prudential Center) for the tour! ,\n",
       " Fun Weekend in Boston Big but very nice hotel.,\n",
       " Great location.,\n",
       " Close to Fenway. ,\n",
       " Watch out for breakfast at the Apropos Room We stayed here with our daughter, who was participating in the Olympic Trials for the Marathon.,\n",
       " Our rooms were excellent with very comfortable beds .,\n",
       " The day before the trials was our one full day in Boston (first time!),\n",
       " , so we were up early (7:00 a.m., which was 4:00 a.m. our time!).,\n",
       " We ate an early breakfast in the Apropos Room.,\n",
       " We did not go for the buffet, as we are light eaters.,\n",
       " I had a fruit bowl, bread basket, and my husband had the eggs with ham.,\n",
       " We also had juice and coffee.,\n",
       " We did not check the price of the juice and coffee, but the other choices seemed reasonable.,\n",
       " Our bill with tip was $55.53!,\n",
       " The charge for coffee and juice was very high!,\n",
       " We later complained to the front desk and were told that they get many complaints about this, but there was nothing they could do.,\n",
       " We could have had two buffet meals which included juice and coffee for $40.00 plus tip.,\n",
       " Avoid the Apropos Room if you are light eaters! ,\n",
       " select another property,\n",
       " I was booked (incorrectly, but that is another story all together),\n",
       " It seems the property and the corporate reservation lines do not communicate.,\n",
       " My first room was a queen $439.00 one night stay.,\n",
       " The queen room was 10 feet by about 14 feet in size.,\n",
       " The room next to mine was being worked on (banging drilling, talking workmen etc.),\n",
       " keep in mind I booked my trip more than a month ago. and was given this room even as a strwood member.,\n",
       " I went to the desk to ask (quietly) if there was a king room available.,\n",
       " Without hesitation the guy at the fromt desk gave me a beautiful room over looking the Charels, with a huge king bed for the same price and a much cleaner and larger version of the queen room.,\n",
       " My question is...,\n",
       " ..WHY WAS I TREATED SO POORLY BEFORE I COMPLAINED?,\n",
       " There is no reason to give those dirty old queen rooms to people if you have rooms available.,\n",
       " I was in Boston for a business and pleasure visit, but will never stay at this property again.,\n",
       " I am in Boston several times a year.,\n",
       " I will go back to the Westin. ,\n",
       " Better than Last year,\n",
       " This is the second time we've stayed at the Sheraton over Patriots Day weekend.,\n",
       " It's a great choice if you're in town for the Boston Marathon, you don't even need to go outside to get to marathon central at the Hines, and all the shopping and dinning you'll need.,\n",
       " (Unless of course you head to the North End for pre-race pasta) Last time we were in a small room with our two boys and could barely walk around the roll away bed.,\n",
       " This time our room was in the part of the hotel closest to the Prudential Center and it was quite spacious.,\n",
       " It had a king size bed and pull out couch.,\n",
       " The kids loved the pool, the adults enjoyed the hot tub.,\n",
       " The fact that they allow you to use the fitness facilities to shower after the marathon is over (well after check out time) is a nice plus.,\n",
       " We ended up arriving quite early in the morning to catch the olympic trials for the womens marathon and had no trouble leaving our car and suitcases.,\n",
       " Once the race was over (still well before check in) we were able to get our room keys and relax in our room.,\n",
       " The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly.,\n",
       " The room was very clean, the bed quite comfortable.,\n",
       " We called for extra blankets and towels and had them delivered within minutes.,\n",
       " I'd like to have had a mini bar/fridge in the room.,\n",
       " The only negative for us was the pompous concierge--the short one on duty in the evening--avoid him and talk to one of the women instead. ,\n",
       " Great Hotel--would stay there again!,\n",
       " Just returned from Boston today, and have to say that the Boston Sheraton was a great place to stay for the Boston Marathon and for it's location overall.,\n",
       " I had read the prior, mixed reviews, and can tell you I was highly satisfied.,\n",
       " We (my children and I) were on the 27th floor, nice room, nice bathroom.,\n",
       " Everything was clean, and just what you wanted and needed in a room.,\n",
       " The hotel pool and gym facilities were top notch.,\n",
       " Free internet service right by the Starbucks.,\n",
       " Concierge desk was very helpful.,\n",
       " Lots of runners stayed there and there was a cool vibe all weekend.,\n",
       " It was easy to get to the T, shop and eat in the Prudential Center, pick up the race packets from the attached Hynes Convention Center, and to walk around the Back Bay neighborhood. ,\n",
       " typical sheraton stay,\n",
       " It was my second time visiting Boston.,\n",
       " I stayed at this hotel two nights.,\n",
       " in my opinion, the room seemed small in size.,\n",
       " I felt like I was going to hit the nightstand when I would get out of bed.,\n",
       " The room was clean and I had a good view from the 19th floor.,\n",
       " The hotel location was great!,\n",
       " It is near Fenway Park and walking distance to the Shops at Prudential Center.,\n",
       " The T subway station is around the corner from the hotel.,\n",
       " I am planning on returning to Boston in the winter.,\n",
       " This hotel suits my needs.,\n",
       " I would also consider a bit more upscale experience at the Westin or Marriott nearby!? ,\n",
       " Boston Hotel,\n",
       " Just returned from a short trip (4 nights) to Boston.,\n",
       " We were delighted with the location of the Sheraton/Boston and its comfortable room, 8th floor north tower.,\n",
       " Being attached to the Prudential shopping mall made it very safe and convenient for me to shop while my husband was otherwise occupied.,\n",
       " Concierge was terrific.,\n",
       " That department simply made our stay the best.........,\n",
       " ....California travelers \n",
       " Great City Break in Boston My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton for one night over the Easter weekend.,\n",
       " When we arrived we had our hire car valet parked, and our luggage was taken into the reception area for us.,\n",
       " Check-in was very quick and efficient, even though we arrived 2 hours before the stated check in time of 3pm.,\n",
       " We were given a room on the 24th Floor of the south tower.,\n",
       " It was a corner room, with full height windows to two sides, giving us a great view across Boston.,\n",
       " The room was very comfortable, and looked to have been recently redecorated.,\n",
       " The bathroom however looked rather tired, and although clean, was in need of refurbishment.,\n",
       " Despite being a fairly upscale Sheraton the room lacked certain features : there was no in room safe, which meant any valuables had to be left in safety deposit boxes at reception; there was no mini bar, or complimentary water, although coffee/tea were provided; there was no shower cap in the bathroom, and only small quantities of shower gel etc.,\n",
       " These are, however, minor issues, and did not impact on our overall enjoyment of the stay.,\n",
       " We were on a room only deal, but there is a Starbucks in the reception area where you can get coffee and muffins if you don't fancy the hotel's full breakfast.,\n",
       " The free internet service in the lobby is a real bonus, allowing us to check in for our return flight with ease.,\n",
       " The hotel links directly into the Prudential centre, a mid-scale shopping centre with a reasonable range of shops and restaurants.,\n",
       " This in turn links to the upscale Copley Plaza shopping centre, definately worth a visit!,\n",
       " Directly opposite the Sheraton (outside the Hilton hotel) is one of the stops for the Boston trolley bus sight seeing tours, and Newbury Street is a short walk from the hotel.,\n",
       " Overall we had a great stay.,\n",
       " The hotel is conveniently located, and accommodation of a good standard.,\n",
       " Would recommend it. ,\n",
       " worst Expeirence in USA,\n",
       " This is my sixth visit to the USA where everytime I stay in different hotel as part of a professional development plan wehre we attend an annual conference.,\n",
       " This time was the worst visit and the hotel played a major role in worsening the experience.,\n",
       " The rooms lack the basic tiny things that we found in other hotels in other states including Sheraton ones as well.,\n",
       " No safe inside the room to keep valuables.,\n",
       " Lighting inside the room is poor and reading was a problem.,\n",
       " Staff were nice but we were not able to get our bills in a way to report accurately to our institutions so they did whatever is suitable for them.,\n",
       " Pets were another problem that initiated allergy for some colleagues.,\n",
       " The breakfast was overpriced like any other hotel, but there was no balanced variety like in other hotels.,\n",
       " Pork is not the favorite breakfast meal for many.,\n",
       " The vending machine was out of order for ten consecutive days and may be more and when we called to complain the operator said try another floor.,\n",
       " This is awkard especially the rooms do not have any mini bar.,\n",
       " The telephones inside the rooms were not efficent.,\n",
       " We were not able to hear the speakers also the fees for a call was expensive even within USA hotels.,\n",
       " The only advantage is that it is related to the Prudential which is a great mall and outing space.,\n",
       " Also its location is great where you can vist some places by walking and easy to get the trolley.,\n",
       " I think some details can imporve the hotel. ,\n",
       " Great for Irish Tourists..do not be put off!!!!,\n",
       " I just got back from the Sheraton and i had been so scared aout staying there after reading these reviews.,\n",
       " There was no need to be.,\n",
       " A lot of the American reviewers expected a lot...,\n",
       " huge rooms etc.,\n",
       " The hotel is fab...,\n",
       " you couldnt be in a better location so it is perfect for tourists.,\n",
       " You are attached to the prudential centre through the 2nd floor..great upmarket shops and places to eat (eat in the top of the hub once it is fab).,\n",
       " The t is also in the prudential and the trolley tours leave from right outside the door.,\n",
       " It is a 4 minute walk to newbury street..again great shops and cafes.,\n",
       " It is a 25 dollar cab ride to Logan and about 6dollars to Park Street and we paid 10 dollars to the Galleria (big mall in cambridge)The rooms were absolutely perfect.,\n",
       " If you are used to staying iin hotels like the Radisson..the rooms are of similar quality..the beds are better tho!,\n",
       " We booked a twin room and got 2 double beds, a huge TV, a big window, a nice desk and chair and a lovely coffee machine in the room.,\n",
       " All in all perfect!The bathrom is a little small but not tiny at all...absolutely fine.,\n",
       " We did stay in the south tower which was important to me after reading the reviews.,\n",
       " From the corridors, it loooks a bit more modern.,\n",
       " The lobby is beatiful, huge with lots of amenities and loads of nice places to sit and have a drink or read.,\n",
       " It has a buzz about it too...,\n",
       " always people coming and going.,\n",
       " The staff in the side bar were lovely too, really friendly.,\n",
       " We had breakfast in the hotel one morning for convenience, overpriced but fine.,\n",
       " There is no need to eat there, eat in the mall!!Overall i really have few complaints!I travel a good bit, i have stayed in tiny European hotels and big 4 star hotel suites.,\n",
       " This hotel really was more than i expected.,\n",
       " If you are irish and are trying to imagine it... think of a 4 star Radisson at home and add about 1000 rooms and a much nicer lobby!Its not the luxury of the Fairmont Copley Plaza but i thought it was perfect.,\n",
       " BTW, i booked on reserve-hotel.com.,\n",
       " Got a rate of 93 euro a nite, an excellent rate!If yook via the hotel, you will pay about 3 times that! ,\n",
       " Nothing Special - A bit dingy Needed to stay in Boston and looked around for a reasonable rate but most of the main hotels that I have used before (Marriott, Westin) were charging around $250-$300 per night.,\n",
       " This property was more reasonable so booked 3 nights via the SPG website chosing a Club room for $199 rather than a Standard at $159- Big mistake!The Room appeared to offer nothing much more than could be expected from a normal one and I agree with the other reviews here that the rooms are small (particularly the bathroom).,\n",
       " The only difference was the fact that it was on the 26th floor (the top 3 floors are the 'Club Floors') the corridor of which was very dark and by staying here you got access to their 'Club' on the 29th floor which whilst providing basic breakfast esentials looked tired as was not the sort of place I'd have wanted to have spent a lot of time.,\n",
       " Unlike previous lounges I have been to, it also charged for alcohlic beverages which made me wonder what was the point in paying an extra $40 per night if all I was getting for my money was a higher floor and a basic continental breakfast.,\n",
       " Needless to say the first night I and a colleague went there and were told it was $4 dollars for a beer we left and went to a bar with better decor and atmosphere!The other complaint I have with the room is that there was no in room safe-this is normally always provided in US hotels of this standard - I only keep my passport, travel tickets and some cash in them when they are provided but they are useful and being told by the hotel that they have safe deposit boxes at Reception was not a great solution.,\n",
       " This again left me wondering what I was paying for couldnt they put safes in the Club floor rooms to give an 'added benefit'?.I used the restaurant once for breakfast and the decor felt very tired and it was, like most hotels, overpriced for breakfast which I sometimes dont mind if it makes you feel like you are getting more for your money in terms of ambience etc.,\n",
       " The hotel is however situated in a good location attached to the Mall with restaurants nearby (I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs in the Mall and if travelling further afield Maggianos, Abe and Louies and Ruth Chris).Staff that I encountered were pleasant and overall the hotel delivered (i.e. a clean and comfortable room) it was just that I thought I would, with the room type I booked, and the fact that I am a Gold SPG holder, got something better.,\n",
       " Compared to the other hotels prices this still offered the best choice, however if you are going to Boston, compare prices and if you can get a deal at say Jury's or the Westin for $20-$30 dollars a night more stay there and leave the Sheraton. ,\n",
       " worst club lounge Their club lounge is absolutely the worst I have ever been at any hotel and in any country.,\n",
       " The lounge is very small.,\n",
       " There is no staff on site.,\n",
       " I was doing interviews in the lounge when one of the hotel janitors came in and sat down in a massage chair, which is very close to us.,\n",
       " He turned on the massager, closed his eyes, and was really enjoying himself.,\n",
       " I have never seen a hotel staff taking advantage of the hotel amenities while on duty and in front of hotel guests.,\n",
       " I asked him to come back in an hour and he left to vaccum the floor.,\n",
       " It was 11am and I had to do the rest of my work elsewhere because of the noise.,\n",
       " The hotel location is convenient being adjacent to a mall.,\n",
       " I have stayed there 6 or 7 times in the past few years.,\n",
       " I think I'll still come back to the hotel but definitely not the club lounge. ,\n",
       " Great Beds,\n",
       " This hotel offers all you would expect from a facility this large, but I never could have anticipate the level of comfort I would experience in their bed.,\n",
       " They really know what they're doing, and from the bed to the bedding, this is the standard to which I compare other accommodations.,\n",
       " Sounds funny, but I suppose sleeping is really what you're there to do.,\n",
       " Great location, decent staff and clean rooms.,\n",
       " The only complaint would be that you can't open the windows in the room, so you're dependent on the thermostat. ,\n",
       " Nice hotel, great location,\n",
       " The Sheraton Boston wasn't in itself anything incredibly special, although it was comfortable.,\n",
       " The rooms are smaller, but you can tell by the area that it's probably no different than other hotels around it.,\n",
       " The ottoman in my room had a questionable stain on it; other than that, the room was very clean.,\n",
       " At $20 for the duration of the stay, the gym was a bit expensive given the quality of equipment.,\n",
       " I didn't use the pool, though, which probably adds a lot of value to the cost.,\n",
       " I went to the bar for dinner, which is right off the lobby.,\n",
       " The service was good, the food tasty.,\n",
       " A big bonus is the mall that's attached to the hotel.,\n",
       " It had everything from fast food to Armani and high-end stores like it.,\n",
       " It gave me something to do at night.,\n",
       " There's also a few great bars within walking distance to the hotel.,\n",
       " The location really can't be beat.,\n",
       " The only complaint I have about my stay regarded room service.,\n",
       " The room next to me got room service one morning, and left the tray outside...,\n",
       " it took the hotel almost 2 full days to pick it up!,\n",
       " It wasn't anything smelly, so it wasn't a big deal, but it showed a lack of attention.,\n",
       " Overall a nice stay. ,\n",
       " I've stayed at better Motel 6's!!,\n",
       " Had a friend in town so we decided to get a room right in the city.,\n",
       " For the first night I scored a $99 room at the Westin Copley (beautiful!!).,\n",
       " The second night they were sold out, so Priceline gave me the Sheraton for $109.,\n",
       " Both Westin and Sheraton are considered 4 Stars.,\n",
       " What a joke.,\n",
       " Sheraton was disgusting.,\n",
       " Gave us a room in the South Tower #1822.,\n",
       " Hadn't seen a renovation in at least 20 years.,\n",
       " Bathroom was sparse and what you'd expect in a motor lodge in a random town.,\n",
       " Just very disappointing.,\n",
       " South Tower is a bit scary too.,\n",
       " Dingy dark hallways with room service trays sitting around for who knows how long.,\n",
       " We should have asked to change rooms but were told that they were at capacity.,\n",
       " Of course, they know you paid via Priceline,\n",
       " so they just don't care. ,\n",
       " OK for buisness stay My husband,\n",
       " and I just returned from our stay at the Sheraton.,\n",
       " He was attending a conference at the adjoining Hynes Convention Center.,\n",

       " Check-in was easy.,\n",
       " All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.,\n",
       " Our room was 965 in the south tower.,\n",
       " Upon check-in we were informed that this was the newly rennovated tower.,\n",
       " Our room was a very nice size for a standard room.,\n",
       " Two huge windows.,\n",
       " Bathroom was a little small.,\n",
       " Coffee maker was nice.,\n",
       " No fridge or safe.,\n",
       " The one thing that drove us crazy was no hot water.,\n",
       " Lukewarm water, but no hot water.,\n",
       " It was very strange.,\n",
       " I had read that in another review, but blew it off.,\n",
       " Nope, it's true.,\n",
       " Having said that, the service was very good.,\n",
       " When we arrived i called and requested extra pillows, coffee and some bathrobes.,\n",
       " They were at my door within minutes.,\n",
       " I had room service breakfast two mornings.,\n",
       " Very quick, like 15 minutes.,\n",
       " Hot and delicious.,\n",
       " The concierge was very nice and helpful with tips and reservations for dinner.,\n",
       " it was very nice to be able to just walk inside and within minutes be at 2 different shopping centers.,\n",
       " There is also a Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs and Legal Seafood at these centers.,\n",
       " Very convenient.,\n",
       " Legal is ok, the service was horrible.,\n",
       " Atlantic Fish Co. was wonderful and great service, highly reccomend.,\n",
       " This hotel was ok for buisness, but if I were going back for pleasure, I would stay somewhere else. ,\n",
       " Great location.,\n",
       " Crappy hotel.,\n",
       " This hotel is in a great spot for shops and food and sights to see... but the hotel itself leaves a lot lacking, especially for the price tag.,\n",
       " The hotel staff and such are very nice and extremely helpful, it's just the hotel itself.,\n",
       " No wireless internet in the rooms - even the wired internet is pay-per-day (and not very reliable).,\n",
       " There are limited power outlets in the room (even at the desk).,\n",
       " No fridge, no safe.,\n",
       " A majority of the soda machines on the floors do not work (broken $ bill changers).,\n",
       " I checked multiple floors and other people in my group reported the same problems.,\n",
       " I just feel like there's a lot missing that should be standard at a large majority of hotels in the year 2008. ,\n",
       " Dirty and in a terrible location We came to this hotel by bidding on Priceline.,\n",
       " We were looking for an affordable place to stay with kids in Boston.,\n",
       " The hotel isn't horrible, but it sure had room for improvement.,\n",
       " The carpet was dirty, the fixtures were old, the TV didn't work.,\n",
       " But the worst part of our stay was the location.,\n",
       " It was very expensive and time consuming to get in to the city with very limited public transportation nearby. ,\n",
       " Huge, but good!,\n",
       " During our stay, the staff of Sheraton Boston turned what could have been a really unpleasant weekend into a decent one by maintaining a positive attitude and going the extra mile in the face of not one but two HUGE conventions of teenagers.,\n",
       " While I would not recommend this hotel for a nice, quiet stay in Boston, it is clean and friendly with a wonderfully central location. ,\n",
       " Location, location - but not much else My colleague and I were booked at the Sheraton because it was the official hotel for a large international conference we recently attended in Boston.,\n",
       " Thus, it was the maximally convenient location to be, and the network of walkways between the hotel, the convention center, and shopping/dining areas was very nice during this cold winter weather.,\n",
       " However, a number of other hotels are also so connected, and we were disappointed at how otherwise completely ordinary this Sheraton was (especially considering the room rates).,\n",
       " The lobby is grand, but the front desk was always understaffed.,\n",
       " Corridors to rooms are narrow and dark, with a dark brown/flesh beige decor that looks dingy, tired, and dispirited.,\n",
       " Room doors are unusually narrow (hard to imagine a wheelchair could even fit).,\n",
       " The carpet looked tired and faded, and a noticeable strip of wallpaper was peeling off above the beds.,\n",
       " Under the matresses the dust covers were very dusty, and one lamp had a large burn mark on the shade.,\n",
       " The bathroom was small, with minimal amenities.,\n",
       " So, a convenieint location if you are attending a convention, but by no means the place to go if you want any pampering, or a romantic getaway. ,\n",
       " Ask for a room in North Tower Rooms are fine but the doors do not keep out any noise from the corridors.,\n",
       " The South Tower is quite run down, needs new carpeting, previously I stayed in the North Tower and do not remember it being so tatty.,\n",
       " Beds are the usual Sweet Sleeper - so very comfyLocation beside Prudential Centre/Copley is excellentThe Maparium around the corner is well worth a visitAvoid Starbuck's in the lobby - poor service and no breakfast options \n",
       " Loved the Room       Nice-colored curtains and seating pane \n",
       " Not good for customer service Rude and unhelpful reception staff.,\n",
       " I stayed for new year and a lot people had parties on some floors where the police had to be called.,\n",
       " Reception staff did not call the police until 5am.,\n",
       " Lots of people complained.,\n",
       " I booked bed and breakfast (paid before I went) to be told that this is something they have never offrered.,\n",
       " They told me to ring the travel agent in the UK!.,\n",
       " No customer service at all.,\n",
       " I can honestly say that none of the reception team were helpful.,\n",
       " The rooms were ok, a bit shabby - not at all what I was expecting for a Sheraton.,\n",
       " The restuarant was first class.,\n",
       " Food very good and the staff there were very friendly.,\n",
       " I wish I had booked a cheaper hotel and saved the stress and money.,\n",
       " I wanted something nice as I was with my 18 month son and partner and that is not what I got. ,\n",
       " city break arrived at Sheraton and was pleasantly surprised after reading fairly poor reviews online.,\n",
       " After being given a room on the 10th floor initially, I asked the receptionist was it possible to have a room with a good view.,\n",
       " The view did not disappoint!,\n",
       " Virtually 180 degree, corner room with sitting room, separate bedroom and walk in wardrobe!,\n",
       " First impressions were that the room was a little tired, but the view more than made up for that.,\n",
       " The room was spotlessly clean.,\n",
       " The bathroom was worn but very functional.,\n",
       " Staff were very friendly and helpful.,\n",
       " Good facilities and location.,\n",
       " Would i stay here again?,\n",
       " I would have no hesitation. ,\n",
       " location location location,\n",
       " As a seasoned visitor to Boston and having stayed in many hotels the Sheraton is by far the best, situated in the Prudential Shopping centre, it is close to everything and very central.,\n",
       " a 2 minute walk to Newbury Street, and the T stop at the Hynes Convention centre just around the corner.,\n",
       " The beds are very, very comfortable would love to have one shipped to Ireland.,\n",
       " The rooms are spacious and comfortable and very clean, I will be travelling to Boston again and without a shadow of a doubt the Sheraton will be my one and only choice \n",
       " great location, staff and lobby... unfortunately that was about it.,\n",
       " I liked the location and found the staff to be very nice and helpful.,\n",
       " The room however was not impressive for the price.,\n",
       " It was also not very comfortable.,\n",
       " The rooms seemed very small and bathroom even smaller.,\n",
       " I will say I was not expecting a suite sized room.,\n",
       " I do travel on business a lot and this was by far the most disappointing hotel,\n",
       " I have stayed at for the price.,\n",
       " 225.00 was not worth the stay.,\n",
       " I will book elsewhere on my next Boston trip. ,\n",
       " Mezza Mezza I've stayed here several times and find the quality slipping from past visits.,\n",
       " My room was very small and barely had room for 2 double beds.,\n",
       " The furniture was cheap and damaged.,\n",
       " The cleanliness here is definately lacking.,\n",
       " I am a stickler for a clean room, and noted stains on the rug and mold on the bathroom tiles.,\n",
       " My shower didn't drain properly to top off my overall dissatisfaction.,\n",
       " I think there are many better choices in the neighborhood, including the Marriott Copley and Hilton Back Bay, which is across the street. ,\n",

       " Wonderful Hotel and Staff Having not been to Boston before I wanted to stay in a Hotel in a central are with nice facilities.,\n",

       " The staff were attentive and friendly and the food was excellent in the bar and my room was a lovely big size and very clean.,\n",
       " I would go back there again and have recommended it to many friends as it was great.,\n",
       " The room was spotless and kept that way every day by cleaning staff who obviously take pride in what they do.,\n",
       " Located near 2 huge shopping malls and high street there is plenty to do.,\n",
       " The staff are very helpful for directing you to places to go and organising tickets.,\n",
